subtitle: And how I spend my time
---

My name is Brett Dickinson. Besides time with friends and family and cats, my favorite pastimes are:
- Watching sports - I love the LA Dogers, AZ Cardinals, and LA Kings
- Reading good books
- Learning new things
- Drinking Coffee
- Traveling
- Dreaming about fixing up my old bike

### My story

Despite what my wife might tell you, I don't ONLY watch, talk about, play, or think about sports. These days most of my time has been working or building up my data skills through Springboard's Data Science Program.

In 2018, I graduated with a degree in accounting but had a strong feeling that accounting was not for me. I had more passion for data and analytics - so I spent my time searching for analytics (what I wanted) or finance (what I had experience in) jobs. I ended up starting my career as a financial analyst in the healthcare industry. Fast-forward 4+ years and I found myself working with data enough to scratch the itch, but also feeling like I was selling myself short of my passions.

I decided 2023 would be a year of change and enrolled in Springboard's data track to invest my time and efforts in building my skills. Now I look forward to shifting careers, solving problems with data, and not only scratching that data itch - but chasing my passions.

It would be great to learn more about you too! Feel free to reach out on any of the links below if you would like to connect!
